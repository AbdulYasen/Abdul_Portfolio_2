      <description>Inorder to reduce the number of owned cars, the city of Tel Aviv launched a shared-car project, called AutoTel. Users of the service are able to reserve a car using a mobile app, and pay for it by the minute. The project that was launched in October 2017 attracted over 7500 users, with more than 50% of them using the service at least once a week.
Recent data shows constant growth in the usage of the AutoTel shared-car service.</description>

      <description>The aim of this project was to see if it was possible to predict the salary for a job in the data industry based on the job ad description. I scrapped the job ads off seek.com and applied some NLP to attempt to identify keywords or skills associated with salary.
The overall requirement for this assignment was to scrape job information pertaining to data science and affiliated roles from a careers site of our choice.</description>
